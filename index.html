    <img src="images/2017 school pic.jpg" alt="Nicole Barry Pic">

    <p>I am a former high school math teacher, who is currently changing careers to web development. During this time, I am enrolled in the UNCC Coding Bootcamp class. In my spare time, I do homework and tutor high school students in math. I am super excited for this change and cannot wait to see where it takes me.</p>

    <p>Also, I am the high school swim coach at Hickory Ridge High School. This is my 3rd year as head coach and enjoy see the swimmers beat their best times. We just changed conferences this past year, which has really chanllenged the swimmers and myself. They need more intense training to qualify for regional and state championships. Challenge Accepted!</p>
